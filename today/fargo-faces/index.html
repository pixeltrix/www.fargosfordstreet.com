<p>Real regeneration is not just about nice new buildings; it’s about the people that use them and the involvement of the local community. When the plans for the street were first discussed, we collaborated closely with the people that will use them to generate new ideas and design inspiration.</p>
<p>Now that we have completed part of the regeneration we asked the traders of Far Gosford Street, both established and new to tell us what they think of the street and why they trade here.</p>

Unit 1 Ground Floor<br />
120 Far Gosford Street</h4>
<p>Debbie Beeston set up her vintage clothing shop, specialising in clothes for men and women from the 1920’s – 1980.   The shop opened in November 2011. Debbie chose to trade here as she recognised that the street was looking to become an “alternative” shopping destination.  Since the regeneration work started it has bought more people to the street even if they are only curious.</p></blockquote>
