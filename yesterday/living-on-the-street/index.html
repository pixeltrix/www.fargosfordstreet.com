<p>As the city began to grow in the 1800s the workers in the new industries were housed in the street in dense developments which followed the medieval land ownership. These took the form of ‘Courts’, rows of tiny houses build at right angles to the street and entered through a doorway in the continuous frontage. The houses were only one room per floor, sharing an outside toilet between many families.</p>
<p>All but two were demolished as slums in the 1960s, yet these houses are fondly remembered and generated a strong community spirit that continues to this day.</p>
<p>The derelict surviving houses are attached to the rear of the medieval 31- 33 Far Gosford Street.</p>
