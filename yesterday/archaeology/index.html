<p>Being one of the city’s oldest and most historic surviving street, the restoration and conservation work has played a vital part in bringing this history to the fore, for everyone to see and experience. The work has showed us a glimpse of how people lived and worked on the street in centuries gone by.</p>
<h4>Some of the discoveries included …</h4>
<blockquote><p><a href="/uploads/2012/10/coins.jpg" class="colorbox" rel="gallery" title="Silver coins"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-256 alignnone" title="Archaeology Finds in Far Gosford Street" src="/uploads/2012/10/coins-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="108" height="108" /></a>A hoard of 38 silver coins found stashed in a wooden box during the construction of Callice Court. The coins date back to the reigns of Edward I and Edward II in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><a href="/uploads/2012/10/thimble.jpg" class="colorbox" rel="gallery" title="Thimble, pin and scale pan"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-259 alignnone" title="Archaeology Finds in Far Gosford Street" src="/uploads/2012/10/thimble-108x108.jpg" alt="" width="108" height="108" /></a>During the 15th and 16th centuries Coventry played an important part in the global cloth trade, forging links overseas.  Various finds including a thimble, pin and scale pan suggest that the street was a centre for the manufacture and trade of cloth in the city.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><a href="/uploads/2012/10/buttons.jpg" class="colorbox" rel="gallery" title="Stocking clips and buttons"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-260" title="Archaeology Finds in Far Gosford Street" src="/uploads/2012/10/buttons-108x108.jpg" alt="" width="108" height="108" /></a>Stocking clips and buttons, worn by the wealthy people during the Tudor period (1485 – 1603) were found during excavations. This suggests that wealthy people were living or visiting the area at this time.</p></blockquote>
