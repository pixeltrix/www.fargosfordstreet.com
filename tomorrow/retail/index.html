<p>Since Medieval times Far Gosford Street has been a local shopping centre with independently run small specialist shops and businesses that offer personal service and goods that can’t always be found on the high street.</p>
<p>The recent regeneration has seen old shop fronts replaced with more traditional wooden ones, former derelict buildings restored as shop units This has already brought in new businesses eager to take advantage of good looking traditional shops in a traditional shopping street, and as the remaining works are finished these new shops are sure to be filled as quickly.</p>
<p>When Fargo Village opens in 2013 it will be the “jewel” in the crown for independent shopping in Coventry. This will bring in shoppers from Coventry and beyond not just to shop but to enjoy the environment, cafes, music and markets that Fargo Village will offer. This will be a truly unique development in the city and a welcome and attractive addition to City Centre shopping in Coventry.</p>
