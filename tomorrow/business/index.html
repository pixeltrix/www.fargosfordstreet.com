<p>You may think Far Gosford Street is pretty much retail and shop fronts, but there are also creative businesses hidden away, in the fields of IT, design and video. With Fargo Village set to increase the number of interesting, alternative, retail businesses in the area, other non-retail creative businesses, such as graphic design, photography and film making, are looking to follow. With the recently built Scala Offices already mostly occupied, and limited office space within Fargo Village itself, more offices are planned along the back of Far Gosford Street, fronting Sky Blue Way.</p>
<h3>Sky Blue Way Offices</h3>
<p>Around 8,000 square feet of high quality office space is planned within two new, purpose built buildings. As well as providing dedicated space for these creative enterprises the Sky Blue Way offices will also provide a new more attractive frontage to the road as it approaches the City Centre.</p>
