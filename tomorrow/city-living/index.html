<p>With the University literally at the end of the Street, a great deal of student accommodation can already be found in and around Far Gosford Street. This makes for a busy, vibrant street with many people already living in it and using the businesses here. The start of the next University year will see more student accommodation above some of the recently refurbished shop units bringing even more people into the street.</p>
<p>Having people living on the street brings great benefits to the local shops and businesses there, and so two new projects plan to bring more accommodation to Far Gosford Street.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the street next to the new iconic hotel will be built new retail premises and 32 new student bedrooms and apartments. Work will start in spring 2013 with a view to being completed the following summer.</p>
<h3>Kilby Mews</h3>
<p>The overall number of people living on Far Gosford Street will be increased further when a new housing project, Kilby Mews, is completed, adding some high quality mews style houses to the area. Work on this project will start in early 2013, and will be created to compliment existing buildings in the street by featuring references from some of these buildings, such as the top shops. Situated just off the street behind the Hand and Heart, this will comprise of about 30 three and four bedroom houses bringing in some much needed family homes to Far Gosford Street.</p>
